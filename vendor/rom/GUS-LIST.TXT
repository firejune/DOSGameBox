     You will find me as J-Mark.  Feel free to hail me if I'm elsewhere
    than #GUS.   I also have PowWow active everytime I'm on-line.  Check
                      me out at markus@nbnet.nb.ca.

			Date revised: 02-03-96

   You can find this list posted regularly on comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard.games,
                  BBS that support the Gravis UltraSound
            and on the GUS internet sites in \submit\glist.zip.
      I also had reports that it is also on the Advanced Gravis Web site.

     Sorry for the big gap between the last release.  The company I was
working for was having serious financial difficulties and had to do some
lay offs.  My energies were spent to find a new job (which happened two
weeks ago) and to move to a new city.

     For Sierra gamers experiencing sound cutting in Phantasmagoria, I'd
like you to try the trick mentioned on the list for Space Quest 6 and tell
me if it works for Phantasmagoria too.  If that trick works for other
Sierra games too, please do tell!

     For those who don't know, the G-List is still available by email
request.  Just send me an email at markus@nbnet.nb.ca with
"REQUEST G-LIST" in the subject line.  The next time I connect, the 
G-List will be sent to you automatically.  But if you wish to write to
me, use a different subject line because those emails are deleted after
processing.

     The GUS main FTP site has moved from archive.epas.utoronto.ca to
ftp.orst.edu.
     The GUS drivers for Win95 are out!  The filename is GF195V11.ZIP and
can be found on most, if not all, GUS sites.  But the Gravis sites has them
for sure. ;-)

     This list was created to help GUS users make games work with this
wonderful soundcard from heaven.  It combines SBOS, MegaEM and UltraMID.     
It also contains a list of GUS supporting demos and programs that whatever
you do, won't work with the GUS, and therefor are the stuff to stay away from
for now.

     Everything listed mostly comes from other GUSers on the Internet and
and online services.  Not everything on this list reflects my own experiences,
also I have put a good bit of stuff in there from my experiences.  If you 
want to add anything, make suggestions, report an error, etc, feel free
to email me at markus@nbnet.nb.ca or chat with me on IRC.  I'm very
friendly (most of the time <grin> :D)

     Although this list is mostly made of games, any other PC compatible
software that uses the GUS is welcomed.

     Please, do not flame me for the mistakes I made on the text.  I am doing
my best to bring something to the GUS world.  If you see bad-spellings or
errors just let me know and I'll correct them. :)

=============================================================================
2.0                     THE EMULATORS:  WHERE TO GET THEM
=============================================================================
     
     I'm using the word "emulator" to talk about SBOS, MegaEM, and UltraMID
although UltraMID is not considered an emulator by many people and MegaEM
is a half-emulator.

     All files can be found on the Gravis UltraSound FTP sites and the
mirrors of those sites.

4.0                    SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY LIST
==============================================================================

     This is a list of currently releases software and the suggest emulator
for the best music/playability combination.  This list is based majorly
on suggestions I recieve via email, and only reflects some of my own
experience.  This list is kept alive to help users in what is the best
specific program and to let them know that specific games worked for others.

     If you know a product that works with an existing GUS emulator or
has native GUS support, and is not shown on this list, you are kindly invited 
to submit it to me.  Or if a program sounds better under a new emulator
please share your thoughts and experience on this list.

     With some titles, you will see a comment on what you will have to do
first to make the program work with the emulator, suggested switch to make     
the software sound better with the emulator, or if the project will only
give you half of the emulation (i.e. MegaEm gives music only).
(D)  Digital effects only, no music
(M)  Music only, not digital effects

  (There are problems that Sierra is looking into at the moment.
   The autodetect sequence is half-working.  IRQ and DMA are not
   always set right and so is the address and the copied digital
   driver.  Great!  This can be text edited, but with the assitance
   of Sierra tech support.  Should be fixed soon.)

  (Someone reported that native GUS drivers are hidden in the game for the
   CDROM version only.  Edit the files SC.CFG and SCTO1.CFG.  Under the
   line "+LB" or "-LB", the next two lines should look like this:
   -mu    (specifies music through the Ultrasound)
   -duXY  (specifies digital through the Ultrasound where X = GUS port
           address in the form of 2x0 and Y = IRQ setting)
   Now load Ultramid instead of MegaEM.)

5.0                    THE "NOT WORKING" LIST
==============================================================================

     You have tried everything, it just doesn't work.  SBOS, MegaEM, UltraMID,
you name it.  None of them work.  This is the place to put those "stay away"
programs to warn GUS users about them.

   The disk version does work with MegaEM, though.  Check the list above.

6.0                           HOW TO SUBMIT 
==============================================================================

     For any additions to the list, please give me the following information
reguarding the program.

---***GAME SUBMISSION***---
TITLE:  Name of the game.
COMPANY:  Who wrote (author of) the game?
EMULATOR:  What emulator works best?
EMULATOR VERSION:  ONLY if a specific version is necessary.
SPECIAL PROCEDURES:  Only if necessary.  Use this field to tell the user if
		     he/she will have special things to do before having the
		     emulator to work with the program.  This involves the
		     downloading of a patch, running the emulator before
		     you setup the game, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     A special thanks to all those who contributed to this list.  You are
too many to be named, but you know who you are.  :)  Cheers!  This list could
not be as big as it is without your support and suggestions.
