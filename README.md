### Package app

```

Where `[platform]` is `darwin`, `linux`, `win32`, or `all` (default).

The following optional arguments are available:

   - `all` - All platforms (default)

- `--arch=[type]` - CPU type.
   - `x64` - x64 architecture
   - `x86` - x86 architecture
   - `all` - All CPU architecture (default)

Note: Even with the `--package` option, the auto-update files (.nupkg for Windows, *-darwin.zip for OS X) will always be produced.

#### Windows build notes

To package the Windows app from non-Windows platforms, [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) needs
to be installed.

On OS X, first install [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/), then run:

```
brew install wine
brew install mono
```

(Requires the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager.)
