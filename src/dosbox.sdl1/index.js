  // closure compiler if necessary. There are various ways Module can be used:
  // 1. Not defined. We create it here
  // 2. A function parameter, function(Module) { ..generated code.. }
  // 3. pre-run appended it, var Module = {}; ..generated code..
  // 4. External script tag defines var Module.

  // case, where this code here is minified but Module was defined
  // elsewhere (e.g. case 4 above). We also need to check if Module
  // already exists (e.g. case 3 above).
  // Note that if you want to run closure, and also to use Module
  // after the generated code, you will need to define   var Module = {};
  // before the code. Then that object will be used in the code, and you
  // can continue to use Module afterwards as well.

     * convenient ways of constructing Longs.
     *
     * The internal representation of a long is the two given signed, 32-bit values.
     * We use 32-bit pieces because these are the size of integers on which
     * Javascript performs bit-operations.  For operations like addition and
     * multiplication, we split each number into 16-bit pieces, which can easily be
     * multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow
     * or change in sign.
     *
     * In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the
     * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.
     * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE
     * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as
     * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this
